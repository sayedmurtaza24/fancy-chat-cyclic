# FancyChat

## About
During my times at </salt> bootcamp, I created this web application as my hackday project.
This app is video chatting application where users can set filters on their camera feed, cool isn't it?! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Demo
I'll soon upload a demo of it on a platform (link coming soon...)

## Idea
I thought there are filters on Instagram and there are video chat applications why not mix them both to create
an app that has filters and you can talk! (I didn't research on if there are other apps doing this idea of course
there might be a lot even!)
